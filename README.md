# Fatorial 2k

Obs.: some fun with factorial 2k design of experiments using Python. That's an on going research/learning, so pay attention for any incomplete behavior or incomplete coding.

Things to pay attention:

- This code works only with unique result for each combination of factors, i.e., when Y[F] | F={x1, ..., xk} = {y1}.
- The ordering factor values are not the same as how it prevais in old literure

## @TODO things

- [ ] SST calculation
- [ ] support for any size of Y[F]
